# Web 3.0 Application 

A simple application that allows users to send transactions and details of the each transactions would be displayed with a unique GIF. 

It was a great learning process for me as the Project utilise Tailwind CSS & React for the Front-End, Solidity for the Back-End and Hardhat along with Alchemy for deployment.
